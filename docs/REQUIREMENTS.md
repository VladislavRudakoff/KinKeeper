Here are some functional and non-functional requirements for the KinKeeper system:

## **Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Registration**:
	* Users can create an account with a unique username and password.
	* Users can provide additional information such as name, email address, and location.
2. **Family Tree Creation**:
	* Users can create a new family tree or import an existing one from a file (e.g., GEDCOM).
	* Users can add individuals to the tree, including their name, birth and death dates, and relationships.
	* Users can add relationships between individuals, including parent-child, spouse, and sibling relationships.
3. **Tree Visualization**:
	* The system displays the family tree in a visual format, such as a tree or graph.
	* Users can navigate the tree by clicking on individuals or relationships.
4. **Search and Filter**:
	* Users can search for individuals in the tree by name, birth or death date, or location.
	* Users can filter the tree by relationship type (e.g., ancestors, descendants, siblings).
5. **Collaboration**:
	* Users can invite others to collaborate on their family tree.
	* Collaborators can edit the tree and add new information.
6. **Tree Merging**:
	* Users can merge their tree with another user's tree, creating a new, combined tree.
	* The system automatically resolves conflicts and inconsistencies between the two trees.
7. **Relative Discovery**:
	* The system suggests potential relatives based on the user's tree and other users' trees.
	* Users can view the suggested relatives and choose to connect with them.
8. **Tree Export**:
	* Users can export their tree in a file format (e.g., GEDCOM, CSV).
9. **Tree Backup**:
	* The system automatically backs up the user's tree at regular intervals.
10. **User Profile**:
	* Users can view and edit their profile information.
	* Users can view their tree and collaboration history.

## **Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance**:
	* The system responds to user input within 2 seconds.
	* The system can handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users.
2. **Security**:
	* The system uses HTTPS encryption for all data transmission.
	* The system stores user passwords securely using a salted hash.
	* The system implements access controls to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
3. **Usability**:
	* The system is intuitive and easy to use for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
	* The system provides clear and concise instructions for each feature.
4. **Scalability**:
	* The system can handle a minimum of 1 million user accounts.
	* The system can handle a minimum of 10 million individual records in the family trees.
5. **Availability**:
	* The system is available 99.9% of the time, with a maximum of 1 hour of downtime per month.
6. **Data Integrity**:
	* The system ensures data consistency and accuracy through automated checks and validation.
	* The system provides a mechanism for users to report errors or inconsistencies.
7. **Compatibility**:
	* The system is compatible with a minimum of 2 major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
	* The system is compatible with a minimum of 2 major mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS, Android).
8. **Backup and Recovery**:
	* The system automatically backs up user data at regular intervals.
	* The system can recover user data in the event of a failure or data loss.

These requirements provide a starting point for the development of the KinKeeper system. You may need to add or modify requirements as the project progresses.
